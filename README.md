# FizzBuzz Program in Java

## Description
The FizzBuzz program is a classic programming exercise used to practice fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and modular arithmetic. This program iterates through the numbers from 0 to 100 and prints:

- "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3.
- "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5.
- "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.
- The number itself if it is not divisible by either 3 or 5.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this exercise are:

1. **Understanding Control Structures**: Practice using loops (`for` loop) and conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, and `else`) to control the flow of the program.
2. **Implementing Modular Arithmetic**: Gain familiarity with the modulus operator (`%`) to determine divisibility.
3. **Enhancing Problem-Solving Skills**: Develop logical thinking by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
4. **Improving Output Formatting**: Learn how to print different types of outputs based on specific conditions, making the program's output informative and clear.

This exercise is not only a great way to improve your programming skills but also serves as a fun challenge for beginners and experienced programmers alike.
